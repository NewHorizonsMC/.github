## New Concept

The New Horizons Server has always and will always be an SMP Server. We use Plugins to help enhance the player experience, however, nothing game-breaking (see the list below) ultimately making us a Semi-Vanilla server. For the second season of our server we are adapting a completely new concept onto the SMP server.


## The Road Leading Where?

**The Overworld** - There is a restricted border surrounding the spawn point that has been set out on the server. We are building a main road together, as a community, that leads west, towards the expansion. Whatâ€™s the expansion? Well, the expansion is the direction in which the border will gradually expand west. Once every few days the border will reveal more land for us to explore!


**The Nether** - Will not be the main way of travel. There will be a few community portals, but the main way to get around will be the Overworld. Of course we will allow and encourage players to make fun builds in the Nether as well!


**The End** - Has been opened for the community. Players are allowed to summon the dragon again, however the outer islands will be closed off until the Overworld road is long enough to warrant us needing elytras to travel efficiently :)

## Enchanced Vanilla

We use some plugins and datapacks to enchance the gameplay and improve some in game tasks and experiences. If you're interested seeing a quick list of the plugins and datapacks we use, [click here](https://github.com/NewHorizonsMC/.github/wiki#6-plugins)
