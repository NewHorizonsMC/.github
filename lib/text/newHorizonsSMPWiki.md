3. STAFF TEAM  & STAFF SUPPORT__________________________

   3.1 Meet the staff  members

On the New Horizons server we have multiple staff ranks. 

At the top we have the Owner: Elli. Below her, we have our Admin: Rainbowmanure.

Then there are the Moderators: Lmella, LOADSAMONEY, Erased, Count_Halcyon and Lolek_Molek. and Helpers: Joah06 and Sheptheboss


More information about our staff team and what each role does can be found in the discord channel #our-staff


   3.2 Staff Support

Do you have any questions or need help from the staff team? You can open a ticket in the discord channel #support-tickets

What is a Support Ticket? When you open a support ticket it creates a new, temporary, channel in the Discord Server. This is your support ticket. It's a channel that is not visible to anyone except for the staff team and you. 

We've got 5 different kinds of support tickets that you can open. They should be selected based on what you might need help with; 

Tech Team Ticket - Technical issues/bugs - Questions about plugins 

Moderators Ticket - Potentially lost or stolen items - Inviting a friend to the server - Whitelisting after inactivity - General server questions 

Admin Team Ticket - Player complaints/reports - Reporting potential rule violations 

Owner Ticket - Questions about Donations - Getting Donation Roles after Donating 

How do I open a Support Ticket? To open a support ticket you select which part of the staff you'd like to contact from the list above. Find the embedded message from the Ticket Tool Bot that refers to that kind of ticket and click on the mail emoji underneath that message.

5. JOINING THE GAME______________________________________

Now to the part you (probably) wanted to know. 

To join the game you have to be whitelisted first, which is done when your application is accepted and join the discord server.

The server IP is newhorizonssmp.minecraft.best
There is also a dynmap plugin which lets you see the whole map, and add markers: http://newhorizonssmp.minecraft.best:8100/#

   5.1 portal hub

The portal hub is the connecting place to different worlds in the server, which are the SMP, creative and event worlds. 
To enter these worlds, simply walk up to the ship, and step on the amethyst blocks.

   5.2 SMP world

This is where you will spawn when you first join the game. Right behind you will be a portal that leads to the portal hub. Towards the west is the main road. It goes that way, because the border expands in the west direction at a certain pace. 


Along the road you will find a couple of places which have special villagers in them. They trade event tokens, which can be obtained by participating in events, for special items.
Player shops will also be around the main road.



Also west, near spawn, is the event island, in which will be information about current/future events.

Also on the island is the community storeroom, which contains any items donated by the many players which can be used on builds that are utilized by the community.





   
   5.3 Creative world

In the creative world, you are free to build anything, just keep it reasonably away from others builds and keep it family friendly.



   5.4 Event world

Like the name suggests, this is the world where any events that require a separate map are held (for example: a treasure hunt event will have a treasure hunt map, a parkour event will have a parkour map…). 


6. PLUGINS_________________________________________________

7. FAQ______________________________________________________

What version is the server on?
1.18
What is the server IP?
The server ip is newhorizonssmp.minecraft.best

No. You need a legitimate copy of Minecraft java edition.
What is the mob despawn Radius?
96 - 28
Can I have the world seed?
No, this is a survival server, knowing the seed would not be fair to everyone! Knowing the seed could be exploited to gain resources unfairly.
Can I stream on New Horizons?
Yes, you can! Check out #🎥streams-and-uploads! If you join a voice channel while streaming, make sure everyone who is in the voice chat is aware.
When will you update to Minecraft X.X.X?
We are always aware of the latest Minecraft versions, and we are watching the snapshot videos to see how it would work for our server. We can't update to the latest Minecraft version until all the backend stuff that keeps the server running smoothly is updated, so please don't ask to update when its released. We will update if and when we are ready.
When do you reset the world?
We are a community-driven survival game. We want to ensure the community has as much a say in how this server runs as the staff team. Big decisions like world resets will be put up for a vote for all community members. But we do usually go for 9 months to a year per world, updates depending.
My friend would like to join, what do I do?
If one of your friends wants to apply to the server, send them our whitelist form (https://forms.gle/dGWdqRZU13Ue95NP6) or reach out to the @Recruitment Team

Not Currently!
Is there a community marketplace?
The market place is not a specific area. Instead players are allowed to set up shops along the main road going west from spawn.
Can I /set home?
No, the only teleportation we have is /spawn. We try and stay as close to vanilla as possible.
Are we allowed to use TNT dupers?
Dupers that do not give any saveable items are allowed, but please do not leave your TNT dupers running non-stop, they do cause lag.
Can we use auto clickers?
You are allowed to use an auto clicker for AFK farms, but not one that auto targets, during any games or events or against other players.
