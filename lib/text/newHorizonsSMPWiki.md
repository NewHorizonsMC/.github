**When will you update to Minecraft X.X.X?**
> We are aware always aware of the latest Minecraft versions, and we are watching the snapshot videos to see how it would work for our server. We can't update to the latest Minecraft version until all the backend stuff that keeps the server running smoothly is updated, so please don't ask to update when its released. We will update if and when we are ready.

**When do you reset the world?**
> We are a community-driven survival game. We want to ensure the community has as much a say in how this server runs as the staff team. Big decisions like world resets will be put up for a vote for all community members. But we do usually go for 9 months to a year per world, updates depending.

> If one of your friends wants to apply to the server, send them our whitelist form (https://forms.gle/dGWdqRZU13Ue95NP6) or reach out to the @Recruitment Team 

**Can I appeal a ban?**
> Yes, you can always appeal a ban, we feel everyone has the opportunity to change and grow and are willing to hear you out. Just send a DM to @NewHorizonsMC
