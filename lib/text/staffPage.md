## Owners
### elli_h
Hi there! 

I‚Äôm Elli, it‚Äôs so nice to meet you!
I use she/her pronouns and I'm from Sweden (Yea, I know, it's the country of IKEA) I love reading and writing, and spend as much time as I can doing just that. Currently I‚Äôm a full-time student, so like many of you, I‚Äôve lived the struggles and joys of online classes...
I'm the owner of this little server and have been with this community for almost 1.5 years :Penguin_Heart: I'll usually be marked as ‚Äúoffline‚Äù on Discord, but most often I am technically online so please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or just feel like chatting! 

My hobbies include: running around spawn, being locked in block-boxes when AFK, talking about poetry for too long, hiking, breaking redstone contraptions, and humming the same song over and over in voice chats
So that's me, I'm excited to meet and get to know you all in game! 

Oh, and my favourite colour is pink

### Twoteaspoon
Hello,
I am Twoteaspoon.
ironically, I don't really like tea that much.
I like ice-cream though, and one of my dreams is to have an ice cream flavour named after me.
I spend most of my time, roaming around the map, building stuff in creative, bothering people and fumbling with redstone.
I don't have a fixed hobby but I keep myself occupied with things like reading, writing, cooking, eating, football, daydreaming etc etc
you'll often see me doing mainly 2 things, writing stuff that doesn't makes sense and dying a lot.
and If you ask me why I have so many death counts,
simply because I'm making up for all the opportunities I missed in real life.
It's very nice to meet you!

## Tech Team
### Xakotani
Greetings, humans. It is I, Xako!
20 y/o, he/him and from Denmark üá©üá∞ 

It's been... heck i have no idea, a long time, but at this point whomever knows who i am should get veteran role if they haven't already...
I'm this servers sole remaining 'Tech team' person. What does that role entail, you may ask? Great question, no one knows, not even me.
I spend half my time creating problems and the other half finding solutions to those problems.
And before you ask, no, i have absolutely **0** special permissions. If you want stuff fixed, go to a Helper or above.

I'm either online 12 hours a day or completely gone for months on end, there's no in between.
Some people may know me for my bad puns, Xako's Zoo (featuring Elli), the speedy pumpkin in creative, the tiny ducks, or my inability to finish any long-term projects.
Others may not know me for any of those things. If you are one of the ones who do not (yet üòà ) know, consider yourself blessed.
