## Who are we?
>We are a semi-vanilla Minecraft server that has a small, established, mature and friendly community of Minecraft players. At New Horizons we focus on bringing the  players together with community projects and events, contests, and even custom mini-games!

>This is an open and accepting community and we want our players to feel safe and free of any harassment, trolling, or toxicity. In order to do this we use a  whitelist and application system to ensure that those joining are coming into a safe and friendly environment.
