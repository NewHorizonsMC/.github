## Community and Discord

To us, the community is the most important aspect of our server, we take community feedback very seriously and have therefore had extensive and inclusive discussions with the community members in order to take into consideration what they feel is most important and what we should focus on. They are the ones who helped us develop this new concept for the second season from scratch.

We have a Discord Server to efficiently communicate with the players outside of the game on this server. This is where all the information, announcements and rules are written and many interactions with players take place. If you are whitelisted, this is where you will get notified about events and you can hang out in Voice Chats.
